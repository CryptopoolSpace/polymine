<h1>Laboratory</h1>
<p>
  In the Laboratory you can research and improve new technologies. Research is
  generated by unused computing power. Researches in the "In Progress" column
  are researched, those in the "Backlog" are not.
</p>
<h3>Starting research</h3>
<p>What to focus when starting:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    <strong>Better Researching:</strong> The first level can boost your research
    progress
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Honey:</strong> You probably want more Honey, so get some level of
    this
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Corvette:</strong> This unlocks further fleet upgrades, But be sure not
    to let your resource production fall behind.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scavenger:</strong> This is usefully if you play active and can take
    advantage of extra resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frigate:</strong> Unlock a new ship and add 7 max naval capacity.
    Free naval capacity is good.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Warriors:</strong> When you need more naval capacity.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Telescope:</strong> After defeating the first enemy you will need
    this to find more powerfull enemies.
